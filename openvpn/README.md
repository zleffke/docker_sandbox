# Dockerizing OpenVPN.
Based on kylemanna images <insert links>.

This path will contain examples of docker-compose.yml files for creating an openvpn image and running it in docker.  Two use cases tested so far.....1) remote node LAN VPN that just bridges clients.  2) remote 'client portal' for accessing 'dockerspace', i.e. a collection of docker containers linked by an internal docker network and accesssed by connecting to the VPN.
